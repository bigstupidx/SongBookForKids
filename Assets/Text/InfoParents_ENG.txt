<b>Welcome!</b>

SING takes the kids on a fun, musical adventure in a beautifully illustrated forest. In the forest they meet characters from 8 classic nursery rhymes, and by tapping on the characters they can listen to the songs. The forest is also full of other musical surprises for little fingers and ears! The app is specifically designed to the cognitive and motoric level of the youngest kids (0-3), and it is completely free from advertising and in app purchases. Let your child find his or her favourite song, and SING along!

For a more controlled experience you might want to activate “Guided Access” on your device. This is good in particular for the youngest kids who love pushing the home button, or who might swipe with their whole hand and leave the app. “Guided Access” keeps the device in a single app, and allows you to control which features are available. To activate, go to “Settings” - “General” - “Guided Access” and set a 4-digit code. To start Guided Access, open the app and triple-click the home button. Triple-click again to deactivate.

<b>We hope you love the app!</b>
